# BasySOS
 This project translates Morse codes in to a text which will is later displayed on a VGA display.
 We decided to use international Morse code which represents 26 Roman letters and 10 Arabic numerals (0 to 9) because Morse code has lots of variations due to many different languages. In this project we used international system for timing and speed. It is as follows,
 
- Short marks(dots) =1-time unit long (1)
- Long marks(dashes) = 3-times unit long (111)
- Gap between each character =1-time unit long (0)
- Gap between letters =3-times unit long (000)
- Gap between words =7-times unit long (0000000)

Our inputs will be both given from the buttons that are available on the Basys3 board.
